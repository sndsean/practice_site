            <h2>Having prepped backstock ready to go</h2>
            <p>Always have 1 crate of each prepped: red leaf, green leaf, and romaine.
                In the 4th basket, have a full display's worth &#40;i.e. the amount you would normally build to&#41; prepped
                and ready to go- 3 leeks, 2 escarole, 2 chicory, 4 kale, 4 collards, etc.
                The only exception would be bulk carrots, cabbages, broccoli, napa, herbs.
                Herbs, chards, and spinaches don't like being soaked for too long as they'll get waterlogged.
